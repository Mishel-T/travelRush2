##Project 3 Application

This app allows users to enter the destination address or airport and departure date. The app then captures the user inputs, and uses event-listeners and different APIs to display the weather forecast, restaurants, hotels and coffee-shops around destination location. The event-listeners are attached to the buttons in the input form area and each of the display cards. The user will be required to enter the destination city before clicking on the Airport button, which will query an API and return a list of destination airports. The user will be required to select a destination aiport and enter the departure date before clicking the Submit button, which will query three different APIs to display the results in the respective display cards (Weather, Restaurants, Hotels and Coffee-Shops). To display more results in each of the display cards, the user should click the buttons inside these cards.
Instructions: 
1. Use the 'Search By' drop down to select how you would like to enter your destination (address or airport)
2. Select a 'Departure Date by clcking in the calendar field
3. Hit Submit

This app is designed to assist rushed travelers with unplanned last-minute trips, by providing a quick one stop search for airports, destination weather forecast, and nearby hotels and restaurants. A future goal is to add features to the app, such as allowing users to choose departure dates within the next 16 days, including autocomplete capabilities so that users can choose an airport or city and state name as their destination, and displaying real-time discounted flight options.

This app uses OpenWeatherMap API to display weather forecast, AirportFinder API to display list of airports within a location, Geocoding API to get the coordinates of a city and Yelp API to display information about nearby restaurants, hotels and coffee-shops.
